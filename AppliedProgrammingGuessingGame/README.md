# Overview

As a software engineer in training, I'm continually working to deepen my understanding of programming languages, their syntax, and how to structure functional software applications. This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** implemented in Java to demonstrate key language features.

The program challenges the user to guess a randomly selected number within a limited number of attempts. It includes features such as difficulty levels, result tracking, and file output to log game sessions. The goal of this project was to become more confident with Java syntax, data structures, file handling, and to improve overall code organization through modular design.

# Development Environment

- **Operating System:** Windows 11  
- **Text Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Java SDK:** Eclipse Temurin JDK 25 (with Hotspot)  
- **Language:** Java (JDK 17+ compatible)

### Java Features Used:
- Basic syntax (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Functions (methods)
- Classes and object-oriented structure
- Data structures: `ArrayList` from the Java Collection Framework
- File writing with `FileWriter`
- Exception handling (`try-catch`)
- Input/output via `Scanner`
- Date/time formatting (`LocalDateTime`, `DateTimeFormatter`)

# Future Work

- Add functionality to **read previous game stats** from file and show a history summary.
- Refactor the code to use **object-oriented design** with multiple classes (e.g., `Game`, `Player`).
- Add support for **saving results in JSON or CSV** format.
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using JavaFX or Swing.
- Allow multiple players or profiles with separate tracking.
- Add **unit tests** using JUnit for better code validation.
