# Overview

This project is a **Tic Tac Toe (Three in a Row)** game implemented in **C#** that can be played either through a **graphical user interface (GUI)** or directly in the **console**. 

The main objective of this project was to expand my knowledge and skills as a software engineer by exploring multiple aspects of C# development, including:
- Event-driven programming with **Windows Forms**
- File handling in C#
- Calling native Windows APIs with **P/Invoke**
- Object-oriented design and code organization
- User input validation
- Application control flow

After each game, the user is asked if they want to play again, and the software offers a choice between playing in the GUI or in the console. Each game result (who won, when it happened, and which interface was used) is automatically saved to a text file (`game_results.txt`) in the root directory of the project.

# Future Work

- Add a scoreboard to track cumulative wins between X and O.
- Implement an AI opponent with selectable difficulty levels.
- Improve visual design of the GUI (colors, layout, animations).
- Add support for custom player names.
- Export game results to CSV or JSON formats.
- Implement unit tests for game logic.
- Improve file handling with better path resolution and permissions checks.
