# Overview

In this case I tried to do something different and create a tool for myself, something simple can help me achieve great things.

I used JavaScript functions to be able to call and organize the tasks I need, if they are no longer useful to me I eliminate them, I also used Css for the aesthetic part and HTML to be able to open and execute the .JS file.

I created this application so I can organize my daily tasks and have control.
